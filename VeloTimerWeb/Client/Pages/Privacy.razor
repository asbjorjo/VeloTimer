            If you choose to register with VeloTime we will collect and store your e-mail address and name 
            from the service you select to use for the registration. Your profile picture will also be
            requested, but this is not stored with VeloTime.
            The e-mail address will be used as an internal username and your name for administration and
            will also be your default display name.
            We will not send you any emails.

            When you register a timing chip this will be associated with your user profile. If you choose
            to maintain a public profile your display name and times will be included in public record 
            displays and with information screens at the track.

            If you delete the registration of a timing chip the association between your profile and the chip
            will be severed. Passing data from the chip will remain in the VeloTime database, but it will not
            be visible to anyone nor in any way associated with you.

            When you delete your profile using the button in the profile settings page the record of your 
            e-mail address, name and any other information collected at registration will be deleted along 
            with any associations to timing chips.
